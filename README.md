# Updating the embedded configuration


The genconfig binary in this package is used to generate the lantern global configuration.
Currently this is run from cloudmasters and managed by this salt module:
https://github.com/getlantern/lantern_aws/blob/main/salt/update_masquerades

If you want to update the global proxied sites list, first edit the global file at
https://github.com/getlantern/lantern_aws/blob/main/salt/update_masquerades/original.txt

As of this writing that gets pulled from [every hour on the hour](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern_aws/blob/main/salt/update_masquerades/init.sls#L48) into global.yaml, so you'll want to make sure it's actually updated before pulling it into the client. You can check that with:

`curl --head https://globalconfig.flashlightproxy.com/global.yaml.gz`

The embeddedGlobal.go found in flashlight is generated by downloading that file.
